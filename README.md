# RogueLike
Game test, for learning game development architecture


After dreaming of programming games for years, I am finally making my first steps towards making one into reality!

This game was written following the tutorials highlighting the Python TCOD package -- https://rogueliketutorials.com/tutorials/tcod/2019/


# Installation

Before installation, it is recommended to be using at minimum pip v. 21.2.4 or higher. 
Virtual environments are encouraged and may be added to a 'setup.py' file at a later date. 
To install the required python libraries, run the command `pip install -r requirements.txt`
